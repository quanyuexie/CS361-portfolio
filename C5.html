                        <p>A sandwich is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or meat, 
                            placed on or between slices of bread, or more generally any dish wherein bread 
                            serves as a container or wrapper for another food type. The sandwich began as a 
                            portable, convenient finger food in the Western world, though over time it has 
                            become prevalent worldwide. In the 21st century there has been considerable debate 
                            over the precise definition of sandwich; and specifically whether a hot dog or open 
                            sandwich can be categorized as such. In the United States, the Department of Agriculture 
                            and the Food and Drug Administration are the responsible agencies. The USDA uses the 
                            definition, "at least 35% cooked meat and no more than 50% bread" for closed sandwiches, 
                            and "at least 50% cooked meat" for open sandwiches.</p>
