                        <p>Cola is a carbonated soft drink flavored with vanilla, cinnamon, citrus oils 
                            and other flavorings. Cola became popular worldwide after pharmacist John 
                            Pemberton invented Coca-Cola, a trademarked brand, in 1886, which was later 
                            imitated by other manufacturers. Most colas contain caffeine, which was originally 
                            sourced from the kola nut, leading to the drink's name, though other sources are n
                            ow also used. The original cola drink by Pemberton contained cocaine from coca leaves 
                            as well. His non-alcoholic recipe was inspired by the coca wine of pharmacist Angelo 
                            Mariani, created in 1863.</p>
